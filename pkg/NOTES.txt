This package has a function 'installedPackages that
recursively searches through R's library paths '.libPaths()'
and their sub-directories. It supports filtering by various
search criteria, like whether or not packages are loaded,
are latest version, are in a site path and much
more. 'setLibraryPath' sets R's library paths to include
directories of packages that match certain version
criteria. By default it sets the library paths to point to
all the latest versions of the installed packages.
