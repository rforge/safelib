Description: Provides support for storing multiple versions of packages in a library.
  Unlike R's versioned install mechanism, which allows multiple versions of a package
  to be loaded in a single R session, safelibs allows just one version of package
  to be loaded.  However, the version of a package to be loaded can be specified.
  Additionally, safelib supports updating libraries with new versions of packages
  in a way that does not disturb running R processes that have packages already loaded.
